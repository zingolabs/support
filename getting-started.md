# Getting Started with Zingo

Zingo is a non-custodial wallet that supports [Zcash](https://z.cash/), the privacy-respecting digital cash.

## Where is Zingo available?

Currently, Zingo is only [available on Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ZingoMobile).

Zingo on iOS is coming very soon.

## Is Zingo a non-custodial wallet?

Yes, Zingo is a non-custodial wallet, also known as a self-custody wallet. This means that you, and only you have full access to your 24-words secret recovery phrase and private keys.

Whoever holds private keys to your Zcash, can spend and manage those funds however they see fit. Sharing your private keys means that you give that person/party access to your money.

## Is Zingo safe?

Zingo is an open-source software. You can check our code on [GitHub](https://github.com/zingolabs). There's also a plan by Zcash Ecosystem Security Lead to [audit Zingo in 2023](https://zecsec.com/posts/zecsec-roadmap-for-2023/).

## How do I keep my Zcash safe with Zingo?

Your Zingo wallet is your own personal bank for Zcash. You have the keys to the front gate, and the combination to the vault. This means that only you have access to your money, Zingo developers don't have access to your money.
